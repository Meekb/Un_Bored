# GET Un-Bored 
## Activity Generator for Indecisive Humans
### Front-End Project by: [Beth Meeker](https://github.com/Meekb)

## Overview
  Have you ever been so bored that you don't know what to do? GET Un-Bored is an activity generator designed for indecisive humans. Using data from Bored API, users recieve a randomly generated activity card each time they click the DO A THING button. A drop down menu allows the choice of nine categories from which to get an activtiy, or simply leave category unselected to receive a suggestion from a random category. Users can Save the activity suggestions they like. The Saved view will allow users to Complete or Delete a saved activity. Once an activity is completed, the card is moved to the user Showcase along with a timestamp of completion. If you're feeling bored, GET Un-Bored today!
  
## Construction
  * Built with React
  * Uses strictly Functional Components with React Hooks
  * Uses State to save/delete user activities
  * React Router gives users an authentic navigation experience
  * Fetches data from [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/documentation#endpoints-accessibility)
  * Minimal styling with plaster wall backdrop for a truly boring display
  * Completed activities are displayed with colorful animated border

From Un-Bored Home, users can generate a random activity by clicking the 'Do A Thing' button:

The suggested activity card will be displayed with a button allowing the user to save it:

## Future Improvements
  * Each completed activity will be clickable, allowing user to add images and comments
  * Activity cards will include links to information about the activity
